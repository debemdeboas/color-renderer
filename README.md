# Color Renderer

[This repository](https://github.com/debemdeboas/color-renderer) contains the code
for a simple yet effective color rendering tool for anyone to use.

My main motivation for the creation of this tool was diagnosing deffective screens that could
not display colors correctly. However, I quickly discovered that the "backgrounds"
generated by the app can be quite good as colored lighting for selfies and the like.

Built on Python 3's Flask. Deployed with Ansible. Made with love.
